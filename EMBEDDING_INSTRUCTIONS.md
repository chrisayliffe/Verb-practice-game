```

## ‚úèÔ∏è How to Add New Verbs

### For Non-Technical Users
1. Open the `icelandic-verb-game.html` file in a text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, VS Code, etc.)
2. Find the `VERB_DATA` section (around line 390)
3. Copy an existing verb object and modify it with your new verb data
4. Follow this structure (conjugation by person):

```javascript
{
    "verb": "YOUR_VERB_NAME",
    "lemmas": ["YOUR_VERB_NAME"],
    "tenses": {
        "present": {
            "label": "N√∫t√≠√∞",
            "singular": {
                "1": "1st_person_sing",    // √©g
                "2": "2nd_person_sing",    // √æ√∫
                "3": "3rd_person_sing"     // hann/h√∫n/√æa√∞
            },
            "plural": {
                "1": "1st_person_plural",  // vi√∞
                "2": "2nd_person_plural",  // √æi√∞
                "3": "3rd_person_plural"   // √æeir/√æ√¶r/√æau
            }
        },
        "past": {
            "label": "√û√°t√≠√∞",
            "singular": {
                "1": "1st_past_sing",
                "2": "2nd_past_sing",
                "3": "3rd_past_sing"
            },
            "plural": {
                "1": "1st_past_plural",
                "2": "2nd_past_plural",
                "3": "3rd_past_plural"
            }
        }
    },
    "ui": {
        "pronouns": {
            "singular": { "1": "√©g", "2": "√æ√∫", "3": "hann / h√∫n / √æa√∞" },
            "plural":   { "1": "vi√∞", "2": "√æi√∞", "3": "√æeir / √æ√¶r / √æau" }
        }
    }
}
```

5. Don't forget to add a comma after the previous verb object!
6. Update the dropdown option in the HTML (around line 265):
```html
<option value="0">drekka</option>
<option value="1">bor√∞a</option>
<option value="2">YOUR_NEW_VERB</option>
```

### Getting Verb Data from B√çN (bin.arnastofnun.is)
1. Go to https://bin.arnastofnun.is/
2. Search for your verb
3. Look for the verb conjugation table (beygingar)
4. Copy the conjugated forms for:
   - Present tense (N√∫t√≠√∞): 1st, 2nd, 3rd person in both singular and plural
   - Past tense (√û√°t√≠√∞): 1st, 2nd, 3rd person in both singular and plural

2. Replace with your preferred font
3. Update `font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;` throughout the CSS

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Game not loading in LearnWorlds
- Make sure you're using an HTML block, not a text block
- Check that all HTML code was copied completely
- Try the iframe method instead

### Drag and Drop not working
- Ensure you're using a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- On mobile, tap tiles to select and tap drop zones to place

### Incorrect verb forms
- Double-check your verb data against B√çN database
- Make sure case-sensitivity matches (Icelandic is case-sensitive)
- Verify all commas and brackets are in place in the JSON

## üìû Support
For additional help:
- Check that your verb data follows the exact JSON structure
- Validate your JSON at https://jsonlint.com/
- Test the HTML file locally before embedding

- **Size:** ~20KB (very lightweight!)
- **Dependencies:** None (all code is self-contained)
- **Browser Support:** All modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Internet Required:** Only for loading Google Fonts (Outfit)

## üéØ Usage Tips for Students
1. Start with "Fill in the Blank" mode to test your knowledge
2. Use "Show Answers" to learn correct forms
3. Try "Drag & Drop" mode to practice recognition
4. Switch between verbs and tenses to master different conjugations
5. Aim for 100% correct before moving to the next verb!

Progress resets when:
- Switching verbs
- Switching tenses
- Clicking "Reset" button
